## 🧱 Product Modules

EasyBake is a full-stack platform composed of one mobile app and two backend services:

| Module | Purpose | Stack |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `apps/easy_bake_mobile` | User-facing app experience (Android, iOS, web, desktop) | Flutter, Dart |
| `services/recipe-service` | Recipe orchestration and business API layer | Node.js, TypeScript, Express, Prisma |
| `services/ai-service` | AI generation and assistant intelligence | Python, FastAPI, Google GenAI |
| `Supabase` | User management, relational data, and vector-powered retrieval | Supabase Auth, PostgreSQL, pgvector |

## 🗄️ Supabase Data Layer

EasyBake uses **Supabase** as the core data platform:

- 👤 **Users**: account and authentication flows are managed via Supabase.
- 🗄️ **Relational DB**: structured app data is stored in PostgreSQL tables with relations.
- 🔎 **Vector DB**: embeddings can be stored and queried with `pgvector` for semantic use cases.

- 📝 Receive a clean, structured recipe with optional health-aware adjustments.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

- Docker + Docker Compose
- Flutter SDK
- Node.js (for local service development)
- Python 3.10+ (for local AI service development)

### 2. Run Backend Services (Recommended)

From repository root:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Or use helper scripts:

- Windows: `scripts/windows/start-services.ps1`
- Linux/macOS: `scripts/linux/start-services.sh`

Stop services:

```bash
docker compose down
```

### 3. Run Mobile App

```bash
cd apps/easy_bake_mobile
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## 🌐 Service Ports

- AI Service: `http://localhost:8000`
- Recipe Service: `http://localhost:4000`

## 🧪 Development Notes

- Environment variables are loaded from service-level `.env` files.
- `recipe-service` depends on `ai-service` health before startup in Docker.
- The mobile app is designed to consume the backend APIs as the single source of recipe intelligence.
